Introduction

Customer segmentation is a process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on certain characteristics or behaviors. This code is designed to perform customer segmentation using a dataset and machine learning techniques. The goal is to help businesses better understand their customers and tailor marketing and product strategies accordingly.

Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akram24/mall-customers
A dataset for customer segmentation is a collection of data about customers that can be used to divide them into smaller groups based on their shared characteristics or behaviours. This data can include demographic information (e.g., age, gender, location, income), purchase history and other factors.

Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive usage)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Seaborn (for visualization, optional)
- Any additional packages required for your specific dataset or analysis.

You can install the required Python packages using `pip` or `conda`:



 Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
code:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git


2. Change to the project directory:

code:
cd customer-segmentation


Usage

1. Prepare your customer data: 

   - Ensure your customer data is in a suitable format, such as a CSV file, and place it in the project directory. The data should include features that describe the customers, such as age, income, purchase history, etc.

2. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

   - If you're using Jupyter Notebook, open the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` file using the following command:

     code:
     jupyter notebook customer_segmentation.ipynb
     

   - Follow the code cells in the notebook to load your data, preprocess it, and perform customer segmentation using machine learning algorithms.

3. Alternatively, if you want to run the code from a Python script, you can use the provided `customer_segmentation.py` file:

   code:
   python customer_segmentation.py
   

   You may need to modify the script to specify the input data file and customize the segmentation algorithm and parameters to suit your specific requirements.

Configuration

You can customize the following aspects of the customer segmentation:

- Data loading: Modify the data loading section in the code to specify your data file and loading process.

- Segmentation algorithm: Choose the machine learning algorithm and parameters for customer segmentation.

- Visualization: Customize the visualization settings to better understand the segmentation results.

Output

The code will generate segmentation results, which may include cluster assignments for each customer and visualization of the segmented groups. You can save the results and plots for further analysis and reporting.
